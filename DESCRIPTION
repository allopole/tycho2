Description: This package provides a simple wrapper for the Project Tycho 2.0 web API. See 
    <https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/dataset/api/> for complete documentation of the API. The package 
    includes the generic function `apicall()` to assemble arbitrary web api call URLs from a base 
    URL and query string terms. The function `tycho2()` calls `apicall` with Tycho's default base 
    URL and applies some automation to facilitate downloading large datasets with a single call. The
    development of this package was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences 
    of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U01GM110744. The content is solely the 
    responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily reflect the official views of the
